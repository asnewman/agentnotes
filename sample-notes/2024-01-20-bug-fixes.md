# Bug Fixes and Issues

## Critical

- [x] Parser fails on empty frontmatter
- [x] Slugify doesn't handle special characters

## Medium Priority

- [x] Date parsing timezone issues
- [ ] Large files cause memory spike

## Low Priority

- [ ] Add progress indicator for bulk operations
- [ ] Improve error messages for invalid YAML

## Notes

The parser edge cases were tricky. Key learnings:
1. Always validate frontmatter delimiters
2. Handle both Unix and Windows line endings
3. Trim trailing whitespace from content
