# React Components

## Button Component

The button component supports multiple variants:
- Primary
- Secondary
- Danger
- Ghost

## Form Components

We use controlled components for all form inputs. See `src/components/Form/` for the implementation.

### Input validation
All inputs validate on blur and submit.
